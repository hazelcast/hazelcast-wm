# How to upgrade Hazelcast Web Manager (hazelcast-wm) from version 4.0 to 5.0

This guide describes how to upgrade Hazelcast Web Manager (hazelcast-wm) from version 4.0 to version 5.0.


## hazelcast-wm supports Hazelcast 5.x

Hazelcast-wm supported Hazelcast 4.x versions, whereas Hazelcast-wm supports Hazelcast 5.x. One notable change in Hazelcast 5.x 
that can affect Hazelcast-wm usage is that Hazelcast clients have indefinite cluster connect timeout by default,
which was previously 20 seconds. For more info on the topic, see
[this page](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.4/clients/java#configuring-client-connection-retry)

To preserve a 20 second cluster timeout in Hazelcast 5.x clients, add the following entry to your 
hazelcast-client.xml config:

```xml
<connection-strategy>
        <connection-retry>
            <cluster-connect-timeout-millis>20000</cluster-connect-timeout-millis>
        </connection-retry>
    </connection-strategy>
```

## Dependencies are upgraded

hazelcast-wm is tested with:

- JSP API 2.3+
- Servlet API 4.0+ 
- Tomcat 9.0.z
- Eclipse Jetty 10.0.z
- Spring 5.3
- Spring security 5.8

## hazelcast:hazelcast-all unavailable in 5.x

As hazelcast:hazelcast-all is unavailable in Hazelcast Platform 5.x, use the hazelcast:hazelcast artifact instead.

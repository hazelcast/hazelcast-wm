# How to upgrade Hazelcast Web Manager (hazelcast-wm) from version 4.0 to 5.0

This guide describes how to upgrade Hazelcast Web Manager (hazelcast-wm) from version 4.0 to version 5.0.


## hazelcast-wm supports Hazelcast 5.x

The 4.0 version of hazelcast-wm supported Hazelcast Platform 4.x versions; to use Hazelcast Platform 5, you need to upgrade your
version of hazelcast-wm.

In Hazelcast Platform 5.x, Hazelcast clients now default to indefinite cluster connect timeout where previously
this timeout was 20 seconds. This is important for hazelcast-wm usage - for more info, see
[this page](https://docs.hazelcast.com/hazelcast/5.4/clients/java#configuring-client-connection-retry) 
or follow the guidance below to restore this setting.

To preserve a 20 second cluster timeout in Hazelcast 5.x clients, add the following entry to your 
hazelcast-client.xml config:

```xml
<connection-strategy>
        <connection-retry>
            <cluster-connect-timeout-millis>20000</cluster-connect-timeout-millis>
        </connection-retry>
    </connection-strategy>
```

## Supported versions of dependencies

hazelcast-wm is tested with:

- JSP API 2.3+
- Servlet API 4.0+ 
- Tomcat 9.0.z
- Eclipse Jetty 10.0.z
- Spring 5.3
- Spring security 5.8

## hazelcast:hazelcast-all unavailable in 5.x

As hazelcast:hazelcast-all is unavailable in Hazelcast Platform 5.x, use the hazelcast:hazelcast artifact instead.

# How to upgrade Hazelcast Web Manager (hazelcast-wm) from version 5.0 to 5.1

This guide describes the changes you need to make when upgrading Hazelcast Web Manager (hazelcast-wm) from version 5.0 to version 5.1.

# Migration from `javax.servlet` to `jakarta.servlet`

WM has been updated to use the `jakarta.servlet` package. This means you must update all dependencies to use `jakarta.servlet` (Servlet API 6.1+) instead of the old `javax.servlet`.

For example, the new dependency to Servlet API will now look like this:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>6.1.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

# Java 17 is now required

Since Hazelcast WM 5.1, the default required Java version is 17. Please make sure your JDK is updated before updating Hazelcast WM.

# Spring Boot

You need to use Spring Boot 3.x if you use Hazelcast WM with Spring Boot.

# Dependency on JSP API removed

The JSP API was not directly used, so it has been removed from this plugin. If you need the JSP API on your classpath, add a dependency to `jakarta.servlet.jsp:jakarta.servlet.jsp-api:4.0.0`.

# Supported dependency versions

hazelcast-wm is tested with:

- Servlet API 6.1.0+ 
- Tomcat 11.0.z
- Eclipse Jetty 11.0.z
- Spring 6.2
- Spring Security 6.4

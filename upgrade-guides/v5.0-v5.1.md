# How to upgrade Hazelcast Web Manager (hazelcast-wm) from version 5.0 to 5.1

This guide describes how to upgrade Hazelcast Web Manager (hazelcast-wm) from version 5.0 to version 5.1.

# Migration from `javax.servlet` to `jakarta.servlet`

WM was changed to use `jakarta.servlet` package. This means all the dependencies users are using must be using `jakarta.servlet` (Servlet API 6.1+) instead of old `javax.servlet`.

For example, new dependency to Servlet API will now look like this:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.servlet</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.servlet-api</artifactId>
    <version>6.1.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

# Dependency on JSP API was removed

JSP API was not directly used, so it was removed completely from this plugin. If you need JSP API on your classpath, please make sure you add a dependency to `jakarta.servlet.jsp:jakarta.servlet.jsp-api:4.0.0`.

## Supported versions of dependencies

hazelcast-wm is tested with:

- Servlet API 6.1.0+ 
- Tomcat 11.0.z
- Eclipse Jetty 11.0.z
- Spring 6.2
- Spring Security 6.4
